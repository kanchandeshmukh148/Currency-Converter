# Currency-Converter
I have created a currency converter using JavaScript, which allows users to convert between different currencies in real time. The converter fetches live exchange rates from an API, performs accurate calculations, and displays the converted amount instantly. It includes a user-friendly interface with dropdown menus for currency selection, input validation, and a responsive design to ensure accessibility across various devices.
